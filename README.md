## I'm Tanvi ><

Student at SRMIST, KTR, working on fun coding projects, AI experiments, and creating vlogs on YouTube and Instagram. <br/>
Love collaborate on tech ideas, hackathons, and creative content projects.<br/>  
Iâ€™m seeking help with algorithms, system design, and exploring advanced machine learning.<br/>  
Learning advanced Java, AI, and data classification. <br/>
I once built a data classification model.<br/>  
Ask me about coding hacks, projects, or my experiences as a Lifology Fellow and contributor to the Goethe Institute COVID Awareness Exhibition.<br/>  
I make life vlogs and university chronicles on YouTube: [youtube.com/channel/UC55tIkirdOlDi4L57M3fztA]<br/>  
Follow me on Instagram, where soon I will start a series of university days: [https://www.instagram.com/tanvikabi?igsh=MWljcmJocDB4cWR2ZA==]
