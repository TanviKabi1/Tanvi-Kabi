## I'm Tanvi ><

Student at SRMIST, KTR, working on fun coding projects, AI experiments, and creating vlogs on YouTube and Instagram. <
Love collaborate on tech ideas, hackathons, and creative content projects.  
I’m seeking help with algorithms, system design, and exploring advanced machine learning.  
Learning advanced Java, AI, and data classification.  
I once built a data classification model.  
Ask me about coding hacks, projects, or my experiences as a Lifology Fellow and contributor to the Goethe Institute COVID Awareness Exhibition.  
I make life vlogs and university chronicles on YouTube: [youtube.com/channel/UC55tIkirdOlDi4L57M3fztA](https://youtube.com/channel/UC55tIkirdOlDi4L57M3fztA)  
Follow me on Instagram, where soon I will start a series of university days: [instagram.com/taikvlogs](https://instagram.com/taikvlogs?igsh=MWk1N3I4MWpsYjk2ZQ==)
